Looking for writing resources? You’re in luck! There're plenty of webpages and videos out there with helpful tips and tutorials. Here, I take the writing center at Stanford as an example of a great resource and include a list of references at the bottom.

## Stanford Hume Center for Writing and Speaking

The Hume Center of Writing and Speaking provides **free, individual consultations** for undergraduate and graduate students. They have a team of friendly and well-trained peer tutors, graduate tutors, and lecturers in the **Program in Writing and Rhetoric** (PWR) who hold thousands of tutorials every year covering a wide variety of writing assignments, presentations, and other projects. Whether you prefer **in-person** or **virtual** appointment-based tutorials, they have you covered.

According to **Dr. Zandra L. Jordan**, Director of the Center, “While the fall quarter is typically the busiest, the Center remains active throughout the academic year and summer.”

When it comes to reasons for writing visits and the composition of their visitors, Dr. Jordan said, “PWR assignments and fellowship applications are among the most frequent reasons” and “roughly 70 to 75% of our visitors are undergraduate students and the rest graduate students”.

I can speak from experience. Last year, when I was working on my PhD applications, I had the opportunity to have several in-person appointments with faculty members at the Hume Center. It was an invaluable experience that helped me improve my writing skills and very likely increased my chances of success in the application process.
