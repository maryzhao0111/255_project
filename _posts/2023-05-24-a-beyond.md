Academic writing and publishing encompass more than just honing your written communication skills.

## Teamwork

In many instances, you’ll find yourself working with others, in a group project for a course or collaborations within and across research lab(s).

## Mentorship

Mentorship plays a vital role in your journey. However, finding the **right mentor** and establishing **a compatible mentorship style** can be a challenge.

**How often** should you meet with your advisor? Are your **expectations** aligned? Have you heard of the **individual development plan (IDP)**? And have you ever felt that you weren’t receiving the support you needed?

Many graduate students and junior scholars encounter difficulties and have questions about mentoring relationships but may not know where to seek advice or how to get started.

### CIMER

The national <a href="https://cimerproject.org/">Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research (CIMER)</a> collaborates with a wide range of institutions, organizing tons of workshops. Check if your home institution is hosting any workshops – they can be immensely beneficial!

## Health

Have you ever found yourself engrossed in writing a paper for hours on end? *Don’t forget to take care of yourself!*

To prevent issues like **computer vision syndrome** or **carpal tunnel syndrome (mouse hand syndrome)**, remember to protect your eyes and hands!
