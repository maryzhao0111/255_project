Did you realize how much academic writing is a part of your life?

## Students

As **an undergraduate student**, you’ll find yourself writing essays, project reports, theses, and more. They are usually read by your professors. Academic writing plays a critical role in your course grades and overall academic success. But it’s not just about writing – it helps you build arguments and communicate ideas with others effectively, regardless of your study discipline.

For **graduate students**, writing gets more complicated and professional. You’ll be writing for an audience that includes not just your professors but also scholars and professionals in your field. It requires more time and effort.

## Careers

Now, if your career goal is to become a **researcher** or work in **academia** (like being a professor), academic writing will be your daily life. You’ll be constantly **writing and publishing** to share your work with the world, making valuable contributions to your field.

But even if research isn’t your thing, the skills you gained from academic writing can still be very beneficial for your career. They’ll make you more competitive and confident in the workplace. According to the Job Outlook survey reports from the National Association of Colleges and Employers between 2015 and 2023, **written communication skills have consistently been in the top 5 attributes that employers look for** (about 50-80% of employers look for this attribute across years).
