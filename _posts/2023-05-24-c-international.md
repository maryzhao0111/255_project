## Challenges & Solutions

Are you an international student? English is not your first language? You find academic writing a bit difficult? You’re not alone! 

These **challenges** faced by **non-native** English-speaking students have been **recognized and supported** by <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1052831.pdf">data</a>.

But fear not, because there’re solutions! 

Some handy techniques can become your best friends. Tools that have a translation function like **online dictionaries**, **Google Translator**, and **ChatGPT** can help you understand English content better and also assist you in writing properly in English. Tools like **Grammarly** aim to make sure your writing is mistake-free. But be critical, these techniques are not always correct.

Just remember, while these tools are helpful, they should only be used as **assistants**. *Don’t use AI (like ChatGPT) to generate ideas for you.* It’s cheating and **plagiarism**, and it’s harmful to your own growth!

**Talking to your professors** is always a great solution. Share your challenges and seek their advice. Besides, colleges and universities usually have **writing centers** and **international student centers**, which provide various types of help. Don’t hesitate to make an appointment with a **writing tutor**!

For international students who want to work and stay in the United States after graduation, there is another reason why academic writing and publishing is important – it can be important when applying for certain types of visas that can lead to a US Green Card.

The most common route for international students to get a Green Card is through the H-1B visa. Typically, students begin with an F1 visa and OPT status after graduation. It can take months to years from F1 OPT to H-1B. And then months to years from H-1B to a Green Card. This process usually **takes years**, and it can be super long, sometimes even over a decade.

While there’re faster visa options available, such as investment and marriage, if those don’t align with your goals, the **O-type visa** can be your choice. It can be much faster than the H-1B visa route but also comes with higher requirements. It requires quantifiable achievements like the **number of publications** and the **number of citations**. Specific criteria vary by discipline. 

So, if you want to obtain an O-type visa, improving your academic writing skills and actively pursuing publishing opportunities will greatly increase your chances!
