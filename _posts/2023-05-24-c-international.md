## Challenges & Solutions

Are you an international student? English is not your first language? You find academic writing a bit difficult? You’re not alone! 

These **challenges** faced by **non-native** English-speaking students have been **recognized and supported** by <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1052831.pdf">data</a>.

In another <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00241-8">article</a> written by <a href="https://www.nataliakucirkova.com/">Dr. Natalia I. Kucirkova</a>, she shared her experiences as a young immigrant woman working in academia. Dr. Kucirkova mentioned, *"Not being a native English speaker, I had to put in extra hours for each paper. The fear of being misunderstood by using the wrong word added to the stress of conference presentations and translated into regular pounding headaches and fatigue, which I still experience."*

But fear not, because there’re possible solutions for you! 

Some handy techniques can become your best friends. Tools that have a translation function like **online dictionaries**, **Google Translator**, and **ChatGPT** can help you understand English content better and also assist you in writing properly in English. Tools like **Grammarly** aim to make sure your writing is mistake-free. But be critical, these techniques are not always correct.

Just remember, while these tools are helpful, they should only be used as **assistants**. *Don’t use AI (like ChatGPT) to generate ideas or write for you.* It’s cheating and **plagiarism**, and it’s harmful to your own growth!

**Talking to your professors/advisors** is always a great solution. Share your challenges and seek their advice. Besides, colleges and universities usually have **writing centers** and **international student centers**, which provide various types of help. Don’t hesitate to make an appointment with a **writing tutor**!

## Visa & Green Card

For international students who want to work and stay in the United States after graduation, there is another reason why academic writing and publishing is important – it can be important when applying for certain types of visas that can lead to a US Green Card.

The most common route for international students to get a Green Card is through the **H-1B** visa. Typically, students begin with an F1 visa and OPT status after graduation. It can take months to years from F1 OPT to H-1B. And then months to years from H-1B to a Green Card. This process usually **takes years**, and it can be super long, sometimes even over a decade.

While there’re faster visa options available, such as investment and marriage, if those don’t align with your goals, the **O-type visa** can be your choice. It can be much faster than the H-1B visa route but also comes with higher requirements. It requires quantifiable achievements like the **number of publications** and the **number of citations**. Specific criteria vary by discipline. 

So, if you want to obtain an O-type visa, *improving your academic writing skills and actively pursuing publishing opportunities will greatly increase your chances!*
